Coherence checking / verification


Object verifications:
*********************

Objects to verify:

	Profile
	Datatype
	Segment
	ValueSet


Dataflow wise:

	Request:
	{"id":"___", "type":"___"}

	Response:
	{"id":"___", "type":"___", 
	eltVerification:[{"eltName":"___", "attValue":"___", "result":"___"}],
	childrenVerification: [ "id":"___", "type":"___", eltVerification:["eltName":"___", "attValue":"___", "result":"___"]
	...
	]}

	Result is either "ok" or error message.



Attribute verifications:
************************

Verifications:

	Usage verification:
		New usage cannot be less restrictive than reference usage
		Use rules.txt for precedence.

	Cardinality verifications:
		Cardinality max:
			Type check:
				Cardinality min must be a positive integer

			Values have to be verified against usage:
			   if X usage, then cardinality min cannot be greater than 0
			   if R usage, then cardinality min has to be greater than zero and cardinality max cannot be less than cardinality min
			   if RE usage, then cardinality min has to be greater than zero and cardinality max cannot be less than cardinality min
			   if C,CE,O, or C* usage, cardinality min cannot be less than or greater than zero
		Cardinality max:
			Type check:
				Cardinality max must be a positive integer or star

			Values have to be verified against usage:
			   if X usage, then cardinality max cannot be greater than 0
			   if R usage, then cardinality max has to be integer greater than zero or star and cardinality max cannot be less than cardinality min
			   if RE usage, then cardinality max has to be greater than zero or star and cardinality max cannot be less than cardinality min
			   if C,CE,O, or C* usage, cardinality max can not be less than 1 


	Length verifications:
		MinLength:
			Type check:
				minLength must be a positive integer
			Meaning check
				minLength cannot be greater than maxLength

		MaxLength:
			Type check:
				maxLength must be a positive integer
			Meaning check
				maxLength cannot be greater than maxLength



Attribute to verify:

	Field 		=> usage, cardMin, cardMax, minLength, maxLength (Segment)
	Component 	=> usage, minLength, maxLength (Datatype)
	Code 		=> usage (Table)


Dataflow wise:

	Request:
	{"id":"___", "type":"___", "eltName":"___", "attValue":"___"}

	Response:
	{"id":"___", "type":"___", "eltName":"___", "attValue":"___", "result":""}

	Result is either "ok" or error message.
